# WPFBatteryAndTouchscreenTool for Windows 10 (.NET Framework 4.5)

Small tool to show battery status (percentage) in the system tray.
The tool needs administrator rights because a mouse click (or touch) on the system tray icon will disable/enable the touch screen. 

You can (i.e.) schedule a task to start the application on each login.
